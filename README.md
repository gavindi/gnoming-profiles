## Wallpaper Syncing (Optional)

Wallpaper syncing is **disabled by default** but can be enabled in preferences. When enabled, the extension automatically detects and syncs your desktop and lock screen wallpapers with full binary integrity (v3.0+).

### **Enable Wallpaper Syncing**
1. Open extension preferences
2. Go to "Content" tab  
3. Enable "Sync Wallpapers" toggle
4. Wallpaper schemas are automatically added to monitoring

### **What Gets Synced**
- **Desktop wallpaper**: From `org.gnome.desktop.background` settings
- **Lock screen wallpaper**: From `org.gnome.desktop.screensaver` settings  
- **Wallpaper files**: The actual image files are uploaded to GitHub
- **Dark mode wallpapers**: Separate wallpapers for light/dark themes

### **How It Works**
1. **Detection**: Extension reads wallpaper paths from GSettings
2. **Backup**: Wallpaper image files are encoded and uploaded to GitHub (batched in v2.9+)
3. **Restore**: Files are downloaded to `~/.local/share/gnoming-profiles/wallpapers/`
4. **Update**: GSettings are updated to point to the restored wallpaper files

### **Binary-Safe Performance in v3.0**
- **Corruption-Free Downloads**: Proper binary handling prevents file corruption
- **Header Validation**: JPEG (0xFF 0xD8 0xFF) and PNG header verification
- **File Integrity Checks**: Downloaded files are validated for correctness
- **Error Detection**: Early detection of corrupt or incomplete downloads
- **Batched Upload**: Wallpapers are uploaded together with other files in single commits
- **On-Demand Loading**: Wallpaper content is loaded only when needed, reducing memory usage
- **Content Caching**: SHA-based detection prevents re-uploading unchanged wallpapers
- **Smart Validation**: Automatically skips missing, empty, or oversized files (50MB+ limit)
- **Content Type Checking**: Validates files are actually images before syncing
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Missing wallpapers don't break the sync process

### **What Gets Synced with New Default Schemas**

**GNOME Multitasking & Workspaces:**
- **Workspace Behavior**: Number of workspaces, dynamic/static workspaces, workspace switching animations
- **Window Management**: Hot corner settings, window focus behavior, edge tiling
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: All workspace switching shortcuts (Ctrl+Alt+Arrow, Super+Page Up/Down, etc.)
- **Window Switching**: Alt+Tab appearance, behavior, and application grouping
- **Application Switching**: Super+Tab behavior and visual settings

**Ubuntu Desktop Extensions:**
- **Ubuntu Dock**: Position, size, auto-hide behavior, icon click actions
- **System Tray**: Legacy application indicators, system indicator behavior
- **Desktop Icons**: Show/hide desktop icons, icon arrangement, trash/home icons
- **Update Notifications**: Ubuntu update notification preferences
- **Dash to Dock**: If installed, all dock customization settings

These settings ensure your complete desktop workflow is preserved across devices, including your workspace setup, window management preferences, and Ubuntu-specific customizations.

### **Considerations**
- **File Size**: Wallpaper files can be large (1-10MB+ each)
- **Sync Time**: Large wallpapers may increase sync duration (mitigated by batching in v2.9+)
- **Storage**: Uses more GitHub repository storage space

- Detects create, modify, and delete events
- Filters out temporary files and irrelevant changes

### GSettings Monitoring
- Connects to the `changed` signal for each configured schema
- Monitors all keys within each schema automatically
- Captures changes from any source (GUI settings, command line, other applications)
- Temporarily disables monitoring during restore operations to prevent loops

### Smart Debouncing
- Configurable delay prevents rapid-fire syncing during bulk changes
- Timer resets with each new change detected
- Batch processing of multiple simultaneous changes
- Visual feedback when changes are detected and queued

## ETag Polling Details (v2.9+)

### How ETag Polling Works
- **Initial Request**: Extension makes normal GitHub API request, stores returned ETag
- **Subsequent Requests**: Include `If-None-Match: <etag>` header
- **304 Response**: GitHub returns "Not Modified" when content unchanged (minimal data transfer)
- **Change Detection**: Only when ETag differs does GitHub return full data
- **Cache Management**: ETags stored in memory during extension session

### Benefits of ETag Polling
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Up to 95% reduction in data transfer during polling
- **Rate Limit Savings**: Conditional requests often don't count against API limits
- **Faster Responses**: 304 responses are much quicker than full data transfers
- **Resource Conservation**: Reduces server load and network traffic
- **Battery Life**: Lower network activity improves battery life on laptops

### ETag Status Indicators
- **Not Cached**: First poll or no ETag available
- **Cached**: ETag stored, ready for efficient polling
- **No Changes (304)**: Last poll returned "Not Modified"
- **Changes Detected**: Content changed, new ETag cached

## Performance Considerations

- **Minimal Resource Usage**: Uses efficient GNOME APIs for monitoring
- **Debounced Syncing**: Prevents excessive network requests
- **Selective Monitoring**: Only watches explicitly configured items
- **Automatic Cleanup**: All monitors properly cleaned up when extension disabled (v3.0+)
- **Batched Operations**: Multiple file changes uploaded in single commits (v2.9+)
- **Request Queuing**: Intelligent concurrency control prevents API overload (v2.9+)
- **Smart Caching**: Content-based change detection avoids unnecessary uploads (v2.9+)
- **ETag Efficiency**: Conditional requests minimize unnecessary data transfer (v2.9+)
- **Binary-Safe Processing**: Wallpapers handled without corruption (v3.0+)
- **Memory Management**: Comprehensive timer and resource cleanup (v3.0+)

## Troubleshooting

### Debugging with Modular Logs
The modular architecture provides detailed logging from each component:
```bash
# View all extension logs
journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell | grep "Gnoming Profiles"

# Filter by specific modules
journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell | grep "GitHub API"
journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell | grep "Sync Manager"
journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell | grep "ETag Manager"
journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell | grep "Wallpaper Manager"
```

### Change Monitoring Not Working
1. Check that "Auto-sync on Changes" is enabled in preferences
2. Verify that your files and schemas are properly configured
3. Check the GNOME Shell logs: `journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell`
4. Try toggling change monitoring off and on in preferences

### ETag Polling Issues (v2.9+)
1. Check the "ETag polling" status in the panel menu
2. "Not cached" indicates first poll or ETag unavailable
3. "No changes (304)" shows efficient polling is working
4. High polling frequency may still hit rate limits despite ETags
5. Check network connectivity if ETag status shows errors

### GitHub Polling Issues
1. Check that GitHub credentials are properly configured
2. Ensure repository exists and is accessible with your token
3. Verify polling is enabled in preferences
4. Check network connectivity to GitHub
5. Review polling interval (too frequent may hit rate limits)
6. Look for "GitHub polling" status in panel menu

### Request Queue Issues (v2.9+)
1. Check the "Request queue" status in the panel menu
2. High pending counts may indicate network issues
3. Multiple active requests show the queue is working properly
4. If queue appears stuck, try disabling/re-enabling the extension

### Empty config-backup.json or 0 Schemas Detected
1. Use the **"Initialize Sync"** button in Preferences → Sync tab
2. This will force creation of an initial backup with all available schemas
3. Check the logs to see which schemas are being detected
4. Verify GitHub credentials are configured before initializing
5. Check panel menu to see schema count after initialization

### Remote Changes Not Detected
1. Verify changes were actually committed to the repository
2. Check that config files (config-backup.json or files/*) were modified
3. Ensure polling interval has elapsed since the change
4. Try manual "Sync Now" to test connectivity
5. Check ETag status - "Not cached" may indicate polling issues

### Wallpaper Corruption Issues (v3.0+ FIXED)
1. **Corrupted wallpapers**: Fixed in v3.0 with proper binary handling
2. **"Not a JPEG file" errors**: Fixed - wallpapers now download without corruption
3. **Invalid headers**: v3.0 validates JPEG/PNG headers and reports corruption
4. **File integrity**: Downloaded files are now verified for correctness
5. **Empty files**: Zero-byte wallpaper files are automatically skipped and reported
6. **Large files**: Files over 50MB are automatically skipped; over 10MB show warnings

### Memory and Performance Issues (v3.0+ IMPROVED)
1. **Memory leaks**: Fixed - all timers and references are properly cleaned up
2. **High memory usage**: Improved - better resource management and cleanup
3. **Extension won't disable**: Fixed - proper lifecycle management
4. **Timeouts not clearing**: Fixed - comprehensive timeout tracking and cleanup
5. **Resource exhaustion**: Improved - better component isolation and cleanup

### Excessive GitHub API Usage
1. Enable ETag polling for dramatically reduced API usage (v2.9+)
2. Increase the "Change Sync Delay" in preferences
3. Review your monitored files list for rapidly-changing files
4. Consider using "Backup Only" sync direction for change monitoring
5. v2.9+ automatically reduces API usage through batching, caching, and ETags

### Files Not Syncing
1. Ensure files exist and are readable
2. Check file paths use correct syntax (~ for home directory)
3. Binary files are automatically skipped (except wallpapers)
4. Parent directories must be accessible
5. Check request queue status for upload issues (v2.9+)

## Requirements

- GNOME Shell 45+
- GitHub account with private repository
- Personal access token with repo permissions
- Write access to monitored configuration files

**Note**: Ubuntu-specific schemas (ubuntu-dock, ubuntu-appindicators, etc.) are only synced when the corresponding extensions are installed and active. The extension gracefully handles missing schemas without errors.
